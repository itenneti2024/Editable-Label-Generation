# Editable-Label-Generation

## Project Description
The primary problem this project aims to solve is the inefficiency and complexity involved in the manual creation and modification of labels for Zebra printers. To address this, the project will develop an advanced automated system that leverages Generative AI to convert images of printer labels into Zebra Printer Language (ZPL).

## Files Description
- API.ipynb: This file includes code for prompt engineering and experiments with the Anthropic API and OpenAI API to generate ZPL code.
